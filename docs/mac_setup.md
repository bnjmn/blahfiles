Need to take a bunch more notes but just recording things I think I will forget right now.
This might make for a better blog post.

- Install homebrew
- Install a bunch of other stuff using brew
- Install a couple things via app store
- Adjust some settings on system prefs (review these)
- Update finder prefs and desktop view options (way to automate this?)
- Install blahfiles



#### IRC

Login with nick on freenode with


```
/msg NickServ IDENTIFY bnjmn password
```


### Firefox

Using different profiles.

Enable different add-ons on different machines/profiles.
Set this to true
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Services/Sync/Addon_Sync#Can_I_have_different_enabled_states_on_different_machines.3F

and then you should be able to enable or disable add-ons (like themes) without affecting other profiles.


Not sure this actually worked. Need to test with restart.
