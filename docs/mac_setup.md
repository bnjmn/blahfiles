Need to take a bunch more notes but just recording things I think I will forget right now.
This might make for a better blog post.

- Install homebrew
- Install a bunch of other stuff using brew
- Install a couple things via app store
- Adjust some settings on system prefs (review these)
- Update finder prefs and desktop view options (way to automate this?)
- Install blahfiles
